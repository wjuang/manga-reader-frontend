Project Description

This app aims to be a relatively lightweight manga/comic reading app. Users will be able to upload images to the site to be collected as chapters, which are all collected under individual titles. Users will then be able to scroll/click through the pages of each chapter to read the manga/comic. Although many similar sites exist currently, I will aim to make mine functional but visually simplistic and easy to load.
